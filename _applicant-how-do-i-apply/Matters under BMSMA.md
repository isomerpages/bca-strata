# Steps relating to an application under Part VI of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act

## STEP 1: HOW TO FILE AN APPLICATION

Before filing the application, have you attempted the following:

1.  **Resolve the matter amicably in the first instance**  
    
    You may wish to approach the other party (management corporation or subsidiary proprietors/ unit owners) to resolve the matter amicably.
    
2.  **Jurisdiction of the Board**  
    
    Not all disputes can be referred to the Strata Titles Boards. Only certain matters under Part VI (Division 2) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (Chap. 30C) can be heard by the Boards. If you are submitting an application, ensure that the orders you are seeking for, fall within the Board’s jurisdiction. Please seek independent legal advice if you are unsure. The Strata Titles Boards is an impartial tribunal and cannot give advice.
    
    If you have filed an application outside the Board’s jurisdiction, the Board may discontinue your application. Filing fees paid are not refundable.
    
    For matters that are outside the jurisdiction of Strata Titles Boards, disputing parties may seek resolution from the Courts.
