### Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act

  

**ENFORCEMENT OF ORDER**

The decision of the Strata Titles Boards is final and binding on the parties.

If a party fails or refuses to comply with the order(s) made by the Board, it may be enforced at the Singapore State Courts.

A person who contravenes an order made by a Board is guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.

**APPEALS AGAINST AN ORDER**

Parties who are not satisfied with the decision of the Strata Titles Boards may make an appeal to the High Court by filing a Notice of Appeal with the Registrar of the High Court. Note that any appeal to the High Court against a Boardâ€™s order can only be made on a point of law.

Where an appeal is made against an order or judgment of the Board, the High Court may confirm, vary or set aside the order, or remit the order to the Board for reconsideration. Directions may also be given as the High Court thinks fit.

Take note that the filing of a notice of appeal does not suspend the effect of an order made by the Board unless the Board or the High Court considers it appropriate to do so. Any suspension of an order made may be subjected to such conditions as the Board or High Court thinks fit.
