In considering whether an order would be made in terms of the application, supporting grounds and documents must also be submitted to the Registrar of the STB.  
  
This application should be served on the Respondent within three (3) working days after filing with the Registrar. The applicant shall inform the Board or Registrar in writing, on the mode of service of the application with supporting document, at least seven (7) days prior to the date fixed for the hearing of the interlocutory application.

If a party is represented by a legal counsel who has another case fixed by the State Courts or High Court at the same time and date, the legal counsel may write in to the Board, at least three (3) working days prior to the affixed date, for their consideration.

**Q12: Are the parties required to keep the Board informed of any updates between mediation sessions?**

No, unless otherwise directed by the Board.  
  
The Applicant should only write in to the Board if, in the interim of sessions, the matter has been resolved with the Respondent and the Applicant wishes to withdraw the application.  
  
If a party writes to the Board on any matter in relation to the case, that party must copy his correspondence to the other party.

**Q13: What happens if the Applicant or Respondent fails to turn up at the appointed mediation time?**

If the Board is satisfied that the absent party has been duly notified of the mediation session and the Board is unable to bring about a settlement of the dispute, the Board may:

1.  Dismiss the application, if the absent party is the applicant; or
    
2.  Proceed to fix a date for direction or arbitration hearing.
