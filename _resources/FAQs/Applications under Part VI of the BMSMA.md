</p>
<p>Examples of “appropriate attire” include formal wear, smart casual wear
and traditional attire. Visitors dressed in singlets, shorts, slippers
or other inappropriate attire will not be permitted to enter the room.</p>
<p><strong>Q3: What are the relevant legislations applicable to an application filed under the BMSMA?</strong>
</p>
<p>The relevant legislations are the Building Maintenance and Strata Management
Act and the Building Maintenance and Strata Management (Strata Titles Boards)
Regulations 2005 which can be viewed under&nbsp;<a href="/resources/legislation/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Legislation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q4: Why must the Applicant pay $500 application fee?</strong>
</p>
<p>Strata Titles Boards’ application fee of $500 is provided under the Building
Maintenance and Strata Management (Strata Titles Boards) Regulations 2005.
The $500 application fee covers 2 mediation sessions as well as the processing
and administration costs of handling disputes.</p>
<p><strong>Q5: Is the Applicant able to claim for a refund of the application fee from the Strata Titles Boards?</strong>
</p>
<p>There is no provision in the Building Maintenance and Strata Management
(Strata Titles Boards) Regulations 2005 which allows the Strata Titles
Boards to make refunds.</p>
<p><strong>Q6: Can the Applicant make a claim against the Respondent for the reimbursement of the application fee?</strong>
</p>
<p>As with any claim you make against the Respondent, the Board may make
an order after hearing both parties.</p>
<p><strong>Q7: If I am making an application as an individual, who should I get to sign my application form?</strong>
</p>
<p>If you are applying as an individual and there is more than one (1) owner
of the property unit concerned, it is advisable to state all the owners
of the property unit as the applicants and you should obtain all their
signatures in your application form.</p>
<p><strong>Q8: What happens if one of the owners is not in Singapore and I am unable to obtain his/her signature on the application form?</strong>
</p>
<p>If the property owner is not in Singapore and is unable to sign the application
form for valid reasons, he/she may issue a letter of authorisation to authorise
a respresentative to act for and make decisions for and on behalf of him/her.</p>
<p><strong>Q9: Can an Applicant amend his/her application?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes. He/She can do so by submitting an Interlocutory Application Form
before the conclusion of the proceedings and subject to the Board’s approval.</p>
<p>Interlocutory Application Form can be downloaded under&nbsp;<a href="/resources/forms/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Forms</a>.</p>
<p>In considering whether an order would be made in terms of the application,
supporting grounds and documents must also be submitted to the Registrar
of the STB.</p>
<p>This application should be served on the Respondent within three (3) working
days after filing with the Registrar. The applicant shall inform the Board
or Registrar in writing, on the mode of service of the application with
supporting document, at least seven (7) days prior to the date fixed for
the hearing of the interlocutory application. The Respondent may thereafter
serve a written notice of objection to the Interlocutory Application, on
the Applicant and the Registrar, within seven (7) days of being served
with the Interlocutory Application. The application shall be heard before
the Board if the Respondent objects to this application.</p>
<p><strong>Q10: What should the Applicant or the Respondent do if he/she wants to add another party to the proceedings?</strong>
</p>
<p>He has to submit an Interlocutory Application <strong><a href="/files/FAQS/BMSMA/revised-interlocutory-application-form-dec2022.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">(Interlocutory Application Form)</a>&nbsp;– Interlocutory Application to Registrar for Order other than Amendment of Application or Document furnished to a Board)</strong>.
The procedure is similar to that mentioned above.</p>
<p>The Interlocutory Application must also be served on the intended third
party who will be added to the proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>Q11: In the event where the Strata Titles Boards has fixed a date for mediation of a case, can a party request in writing for a postponement of a date?</strong>
</p>
<p>In general, the Strata Titles Boards does not allow any adjournment of
a case, unless there are extenuating circumstances. The Board may consider
such request, given that parties write in with their supporting grounds
and documents at least seven (7) working days prior to the scheduled date.</p>
<p>If a party is represented by a legal counsel who has another case fixed
by the State Courts or High Court at the same time and date, the legal
counsel may write in to the Board, at least seven (7) working days prior
to the affixed date, for their consideration.</p>
<p><strong>Q12: Are the parties required to keep the Board informed of any updates between mediation sessions?</strong>
</p>
<p>No, unless otherwise directed by the Board.</p>
<p>The Applicant should only write in to the Board if, in the interim of
sessions, the matter has been resolved with the Respondent and the Applicant
wishes to withdraw the application.</p>
<p>If a party writes to the Board on any matter in relation to the case,
that party must copy his correspondence to the other party.</p>
<p><strong>Q13: What happens if the Applicant or Respondent fails to turn up at the appointed mediation time?</strong>
</p>
<p>If the Board is satisfied that the absent party has been duly notified
of the mediation session and the Board is unable to bring about a settlement
of the dispute, the Board may:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dismiss the application, if the absent party is the applicant; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proceed to fix a date for direction or arbitration hearing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Q14: Does the Strata Titles Boards provide minutes of meetings and mediation to the parties?</strong>
</p>
<p>No, as the meetings and mediations are private and confidential and ‘Without
Prejudice’. Any minutes recorded by Strata Titles Boards are for its internal
use only.</p>
<p><strong>Q15: What section(s) of the BMSMA applies to my application case?</strong>
</p>

to provide legal service. You should refer to the guide in your application
