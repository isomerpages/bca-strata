# **Who Are We**
The Strata Titles Boards are tribunals established under the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (BMSMA) to mediate and hear applications between subsidiary proprietors and management corporation, or between subsidiary proprietors, in matters relating to certain disputes arising in respect of strata titled property and orders for collective sales of property under the Land Titles (Strata) Act.

Common disputes brought before the Boards include those on inter-floor water leakages, performance or failure to perform certain duties under the BMSMA or by-laws, applications to convene meetings or invalidate resolutions passed by the management corporations, car parking woes, complaints with regards to alterations to common property, applications to revoke or invalidate certain by-laws, supply of information by management corporation, or management corporation requesting to enter an apartment to carry out particular work.

As a neutral tribunal, the Strata Titles Boards does not advise one party against the other nor provide legal advice on any matter which may potentially be heard beforeÂ it.
