Objection to any Board member will be submitted for the President’s consideration.

### STEP 3: NOTICE OF MEDIATION DATE

A **Notice of Mediation** will be issued to the Applicant and Respondent to attend a mediation at the Strata Titles Boards on a specified date and time. Both parties must attend the mediation.

No fees are payable for the first two (2) mediations. Please see [Fees](https://www.stratatb.gov.sg/resources-fees.html) under ‘Resources’ for the mediation/hearing fees payable under the Building Maintenance and Strata Management (Strata Titles Boards) Regulations 2005.
